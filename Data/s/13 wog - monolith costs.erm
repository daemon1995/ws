** MONOLITH TOLL
** окюрмше лнмнкхрш

* Option 065 by Steven Lynch (script65)

* Normally with two-way liths there is no cost for quite high reward:
* to be able to visit many areas of the map and gain access to non-guarded items and map locations.
* It seems to make sense to have some sort of cost for using two-way liths, even if not extravagant.
* One-way liths will continue to be free, as they are not susceptible to being used over and over again like two-way liths are.

* The cost to use a two-way lith is 100 gold per week for human players
* and 50 gold per week for AI players, but if the AI has no gold, it will still be able to use the lith.
